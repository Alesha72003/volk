# List of authors resubmitting their contributions under LGPL-3.0-or-later

VOLK is going to migrating from GNU General Public License v3.0 or later (GPL-3.0-or-later) 
to GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 or later (LGPL-3.0-or-later).

This file is a list of the authors who agreed to resubmit their code 
under the LGPL-3.0-or-later license to this repository. 
In case the affected code is licensed differently than VOLK's current license (GPL-3.0-or-later), 
this gives the right to use the current contributions under both LGPL-3.0-or-later and that other license.
Future contributions by these authors are, however, 
licensed under LGPL-3.0-or-later, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
